# GitHub Actions Overview

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is an integrated CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform provided by GitHub that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment workflows directly from your GitHub repository. It enables you to create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

## Core Components

1. **Workflows**: Automated procedures defined in YAML format stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

2. **Events**: Specific activities that trigger workflow execution (e.g., push, pull request, release creation).

3. **Jobs**: Sets of steps executed on the same runner. Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.

4. **Steps**: Individual tasks that can run commands or use actions.

5. **Actions**: Reusable units that perform complex, frequently repeated tasks.

6. **Runners**: Servers (virtual machines) that execute workflows. GitHub provides runners or you can host your own.

## Basic Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'
          
      - name: Build
        run: go build -v ./...
        
      - name: Test
        run: go test -v ./...
```

## Key Benefits

- **Integration**: Natively integrated with GitHub repositories
- **Automation**: Automates software workflows from build to deployment
- **Cross-platform**: Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments
- **Reusable Actions**: Leverages community-built actions to reduce boilerplate
- **Matrix Builds**: Tests against multiple versions and platforms simultaneously
- **Self-hosting option**: Run workflows on your own infrastructure

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Compute Resources**: GitHub-hosted runners have specific RAM, CPU, and storage limits
- **Usage Limits**: Quotas for job execution time, concurrent jobs, and API requests
- **Secrets Management**: Secure but requires careful handling
- **Cost**: Free tier available, with usage limits for public repositories

## Workflow Optimization Tips

1. **Caching Dependencies**: Use `actions/cache` to speed up builds
2. **Conditional Execution**: Run jobs only when necessary with `if` conditions
3. **Artifact Management**: Store and share build outputs between jobs
4. **Matrix Strategy**: Build and test across multiple configurations simultaneously
