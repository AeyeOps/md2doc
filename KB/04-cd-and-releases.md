# Continuous Deployment and Release Automation

## Implementing CD Pipelines for Go Applications

Continuous Deployment (CD) extends CI by automatically deploying successful builds to various environments. For Go applications, the CD process typically involves:

1. **Building and testing** (CI phase)
2. **Creating release artifacts**
3. **Deploying to environments** (staging, production)
4. **Post-deployment verification**

## Release Workflow for Go Applications

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  goreleaser:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'
          
      - name: Run GoReleaser
        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v4
        with:
          distribution: goreleaser
          version: latest
          args: release --clean
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Manual and Automated Approvals

For safer deployment, implement manual approval gates:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: ./scripts/deploy.sh staging
        
  deploy-production:
    needs: deploy-staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://example.com
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

By configuring protection rules for the production environment in GitHub, this creates a manual approval step before deployment.

## Semantic Versioning with Tags

Leverage Git tags for triggering releases:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
```

## Deploying to Different Platforms

### Docker Container Deployment

```yaml
- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
  
- name: Login to Docker Hub
  uses: docker/login-action@v3
  with:
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
    
- name: Build and push
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: user/app:latest,user/app:${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### Cloud Platform Deployment

#### AWS:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-west-2
    
- name: Deploy to AWS Lambda
  run: |
    aws lambda update-function-code \
      --function-name md2docx-function \
      --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

#### Google Cloud:

```yaml
- name: Set up Cloud SDK
  uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1
  
- name: Deploy to Google Cloud Run
  run: |
    gcloud run deploy md2docx \
      --image gcr.io/project/md2docx:${{ github.ref_name }} \
      --platform managed \
      --region us-central1 \
      --allow-unauthenticated
```

## Release Notes Generation

Automatically generate release notes from commit messages:

```yaml
- name: Generate Release Notes
  id: generate_notes
  uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    
- name: Create Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
  with:
    name: Release ${{ github.ref_name }}
    body: ${{ steps.generate_notes.outputs.body }}
    files: |
      dist/*.tar.gz
      dist/*.zip
```

## Staged Multi-Environment Deployment

Pipeline promoting code through environments:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # Build and test steps
    
  deploy-dev:
    needs: build
    environment:
      name: development
      url: https://dev.example.com
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to development
        run: ./deploy.sh dev
        
  deploy-staging:
    needs: deploy-dev
    environment:
      name: staging
      url: https://staging.example.com
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: ./deploy.sh staging
        
  deploy-production:
    needs: deploy-staging
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://example.com
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh production
```

## Scheduled Deployments

Deploy at specific times or off-peak hours:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Every day at 2am
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'
```

## Automated Rollbacks

Implement automated rollbacks when deployments fail:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy
    id: deploy
    run: ./deploy.sh
    continue-on-error: true
    
  - name: Rollback on failure
    if: steps.deploy.outcome == 'failure'
    run: ./rollback.sh
```

## Best Practices for CD

1. **Environment Separation**: Use GitHub Environments to separate deployments
2. **Secrets Management**: Store sensitive information as GitHub Secrets
3. **Idempotent Deployments**: Ensure deployments can be run multiple times safely
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Trigger monitoring alerts after deployments
5. **Blue-Green Deployments**: Use zero-downtime deployment strategies
6. **Canary Releases**: Deploy to a subset of users first to detect issues
7. **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of who approved which deployments
8. **Validation**: Add post-deployment validation steps to confirm functionality
