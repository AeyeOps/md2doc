> **From Markdown to Word in seconds** - A lightning-fast CLI converter built in under an hour!

**md2docx** is a powerful command-line tool that converts Markdown files to Microsoft Word `.docx` documents using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Transform your documentation workflow with a single command or right-click - no Microsoft Office required!

## üåü Why md2docx?

This project was born from necessity - created in less than an hour to solve a common problem: converting markdown to Word documents without opening bloated applications or dealing with complex environments. It's the perfect example of how a simple Go utility can save hours of time.

## üîÑ How It Works

    style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#6d6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ **Ultra-Fast Conversion** - Markdown to `.docx` with a single command
- üé® **Custom Styling** - Use reference `.docx` templates for professional formatting
- üñ±Ô∏è **Windows Integration** - Right-click on any `.md` file to instantly convert
- üîß **Zero Config** - Works out of the box with minimal dependencies
- üì¶ **Cross-Platform** - Pre-built binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üìã Requirements

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) installed and available in your `PATH`
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (‚â• 1.20) only if building from source

## üîß Installation

### 1. Using Go install

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Go
    participant System
    
    User->>Go: go install github.com/aeyeops/md2doc/cmd/md2docx@latest
    Go->>System: Download and compile source
    Go->>System: Place binary in GOPATH/bin
    System-->>User: md2docx command available
```

Ensure you have Go installed (‚â•1.20) and that your `$GOPATH/bin` (Linux/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` (Windows) is in your `PATH`, then run:
```bash
go install github.com/aeyeops/md2doc/cmd/md2docx@latest
```

### 2. Build from source

Clone the repository and build locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeyeops/md2doc.git
cd md2doc
go build -o md2docx ./cmd/md2docx
```
For cross‚Äëcompiling to Windows on Linux/macOS:
```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o md2docx.exe ./cmd/md2docx
```
Copy the resulting binary (`md2docx` or `md2docx.exe`) to a directory in your `PATH`.

### 3. Pre‚Äëbuilt binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/AeyeOps/md2doc/releases), extract it, and place the `md2docx` (or `md2docx.exe`) binary into a directory in your `PATH`.

### 4. Homebrew (macOS)

Install via Homebrew from the included formula:
```bash
brew install --build-from-source ./packaging/homebrew/md2docx.rb
```

## üöÄ Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
md2docx [options] input.md
```

Options:
- `-template path` : Path to a reference `.docx` template file (to control styles, margins, and page size)
- `-verbose`       : Enable verbose output

The output file will be created next to the input file with the same base name and a `.docx` extension.

## üìÇ Examples

We‚Äôve included an [example Markdown file](examples/sample.md) demonstrating headings, lists, code blocks, and diagrams. To generate the corresponding Word document:
```bash
md2docx examples/sample.md
# This produces examples/sample.docx alongside sample.md
```
Feel free to open the resulting `.docx` in Microsoft Word to inspect the formatting, page size (US Letter), and embedded diagram.

## üì¶ Packaging

We provide installers and packages for easy installation via GitHub Releases:
- **Windows**: NSIS installer (`md2docx-<version>-installer.exe`)
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `.deb` package (`md2docx_<version>_amd64.deb`)
- **macOS**: Tarball (`md2docx_<version>_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`) and Homebrew formula

## üñ±Ô∏è Windows Shell Integration

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Double-click windows-context-menu.reg] --> B[Import Registry File]
    B --> C[Right-click on .md file]
    C --> D[Select 'Generate Word Document']
    D --> E[Word Document Created]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style E fill:#6d6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

Import the registry file to add a "Generate Word Document" context menu option for Markdown files:
1. Double-click `windows-context-menu.reg` on Windows
2. Confirm the prompt to import into the registry
3. Right-click on a `.md` file and select **Generate Word Document**

See [`windows-context-menu.reg`](windows-context-menu.reg) for details.

## üîÑ CI & Releases

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated releases:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Push to main] --> B[CI Workflow]
    B --> C{Tests & Builds}
    C -->|Pass| D[Ready for Release]
    C -->|Fail| E[Fix Issues]
    
    F[Create Tag] --> G[Release Workflow]
    G --> H[Cross-Compile]
    H --> I[Create Release Assets]
    I --> J[Publish Release]
```

- **CI**: Builds and tests on push/PR to `main` (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- **Releases**:
  - On pushing a version tag matching `v*.*.*`, the release workflow:
    1. Cross‚Äëcompiles Linux, Windows, and macOS binaries
    2. Packages each into ZIP archives
    3. Creates a GitHub Release with auto‚Äëgenerated release notes
    4. Uploads the ZIP assets to the release
  - You can also manually trigger the release workflow via the **Run workflow** button under the Actions tab

To publish a new release:
```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main --tags
```
